# Education's Digital Transformation

The current generation of students will change careers more times than any other in history. The market place is responding and offering a wide variety of new education models. In the traditional university system, change happens slowly, we are still educating people for one career. Our current model is both too expensive and too long. Join us for conversations on the changing models of education, educational technology, and opportunities for global scale education.
